          The Dead Space remake may not feel entirely necessary, but it improves upon the original with some smart new additions to almost every aspect of its design.XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactics video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. It is the sequel to 2012's reboot of the series, XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its challenging difficulty, strategic depth, and improved story. However, some criticized its technical issues and lack of innovation.
